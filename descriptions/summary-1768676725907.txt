 In these images, we see an underwater scene where a scuba diver is interacting with sea turtles. The first image shows a diver in a black wetsuit holding a flipper near some coral or rocks and swimming close to a sea turtle. The second image captures the diver interacting with two sea turtles, one of which appears to be poking its head out of the coral reef. Both images depict a clear blue underwater environment with sunlight filtering through from above, creating a bright atmosphere. The third image shows the diver looking at an object in the water, which is a sea turtle.
